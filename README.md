- [ ] Green flask gives charges of Power Belch, burp kills enemies around player, small one charge, large 3 charges

- [ ] Chests can contain flasks, coins, or may be mimics

- ~~Coins can be collected and spent in shops, enemies drop and scatter coins~~
- [ ] Coins can be collected through multiple game runs to unlock more characters
