# Gush

A roguelike game for kaboom.js

Potential game mechanics:
- golden flask gives charges of Power Belch, burp kills enemies around player, small one charge, large 3 charges
- Certain weapons can be picked up for a limited time, more powerful, replaces normal weapon
- Green flask makes player hulk out, transform to huge sprite, trample enemies, super punch? (maybe gain green hearts?)
- Red flask restores hp of course
- HP is always in increments of 1, each 1 represents half a heart
- Blue flask... maybe invincibility? faster attacks?
- Chests can contain flasks, or may spawn enemies
- Crates can be whacked and sent flying into enemies
- Coins can be collected and spent in shops, enemies drop and scatter coins
- Necromancers raise 1 hit skeletons
